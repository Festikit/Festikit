# Festikit

The objective of this project is to create a web application allowing the **management of volunteers** of several festivals. The organization of the latter is based on the presence of approximately 50 volunteers. The purpose of this application is to **generate a schedule of volunteers** to fill the different positions while respecting the preferences of volunteers as much as possible.

## Functioning

### Step 1

A **festival-goer** can create his new festival.
He must indicate several informations:
- The different positions of the volunteers and for each position 
- The number of volunteers he wants at each time of the day.

### Step 2

A **volunteer** can apply for the festival he want.
He must indicate several informations:
- His personnal informations
- Position preferences (reception, bar, etc.)
- Working time preferences

### Step 3

A **schedule** is automatically generated to meet the requirements of the festival-goer. While respecting the preferences of the volunteers as much as possible.
